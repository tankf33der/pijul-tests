I am developing a set of simple and robust scripts to test `pijul`
according to my specific requirements and expectations.
These scripts are designed to thoroughly evaluate the performance
and reliability of Pijul, ensuring it meets my standards for version
control efficiency and usability. By tailoring the tests to my own
criteria, I aim to highlight any potential issues and validate the
overall functionality of Pijul in a variety of scenarios."

Have fun!

I am developing a set of simple and robust scripts to test `pijul`
according to my specific requirements and expectations.

These scripts are designed to thoroughly evaluate the performance
and reliability of `pijul`, ensuring it meets my standards for version
control efficiency and usability.

By tailoring the tests to my own criteria, I aim to highlight any
potential issues and validate the overall functionality
of `pijul` in a variety of scenarios.

Have fun!
